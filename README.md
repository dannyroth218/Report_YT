# Reports_YT
A simple scripting project for automating YouTube channel analytics with Groovy!
Tutorial video to be added later possibly.

### Note: This is a work in progress!

## Description
Reports_YT is a project to make a simple way to automate YouTube channel analytics into an HTML report that can then be emailed or exported. The project is built in Groovy (https://groovy-lang.org/) and is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## Goals
Below are the current goals of the project:
- Create a script so easy anyone can use it regardless of scripting knowledge
- Pull YouTube analytics and format in an east to read and customizable HTML file
- Optionally export the data into other formats such as CSV and JSON
- Easy to use email system and automation

The end user should be able to update a single settings file to provide information needed to scrape the YouTube analytics and provide a SMTP server for email options.

A video of no more than 5 minutes should be able to explain how to use and run the Groovy script on Windows and macOS.
